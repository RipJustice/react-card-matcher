# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Project Notes
This project is meant to be a demo for the moment that is basically a redo of the angular version that is also available in my repo to show that essentially similar logic can be used to create the same application in React as was used for Angular. While there are certainly differences in structure and logic to a degree, almost all the styling and html is exactly the same and the logic here is all based on and derived from the logic I used in the angular version. This version does not yet have unit tests of any sort. I may add those in the future. It does have routing and the main page is also lazy loaded in a similar manner to the angular version.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
